## This program will create a matrix and then allow for the 
## inversion of the matrix.  If the matrix has already been inverted 
## it pulls it from cache instead of redoing the work.  If not 
## inverted then it inverts the matrix and also saves a copy to a cache.


## Create a Matrix from passed matrix same size and shape.   

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Return the inverse of the passed matrix.  Cache inverse matrix allowing for
## checking if the matrix has already been inverted. if not inverted then 
## invert save and return. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
